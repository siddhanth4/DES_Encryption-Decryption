
# Encryption-Decryption Tool

This project is a **Encryption & Decryption Tool** built with **React**. It provides a simple web interface to encrypt and decrypt messages using the DES, AES & Blowfish algorithm. The project aims to demonstrate the implementation of Symmetric Cryptography in a user-friendly way.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core programming language
- **CSS**: Styling for the app
- **Encryption & Decryption Algorithm**: The core encryption and decryption functionality is implemented using JavaScript.
